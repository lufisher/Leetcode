Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

Example 1:
Input: "UD"
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: "LL"
Output: false

//方法：无非就是记录位置 time O(n) space O(1)，很简单
class Solution {
public:
	bool judgeCircle(string moves) {
		int col = 0, raw = 0;
		for(auto &c:moves)
			switch (c) {
			case 'R':
				++raw;
				break;
			case 'L':
				--raw;
				break;
			case 'U':
				++col;
				break;
			case 'D':
				--col;
				break;
			}
		if (raw == 0 && col == 0)
			return true;
		else
			return false;
	}
};
